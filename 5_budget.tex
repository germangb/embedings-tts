\chapter{Budget}

The cost of this project comes from the sever uptime and the salary of the author and advisors.

The project was developed using the computing resources from the VEU lab, and we've estimated its cost by using the pricing from Amazon Web Services.

The supervisors and advisors are assumed to have the wage of senior engineers, and my position to be that of a junior engineer.

The time spent on this project was 20 weeks in total.
